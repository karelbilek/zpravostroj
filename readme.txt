ummm... hello

this is a school project, that downloads stuff from major czech news sources, puts it in a BIIIIG database and then tries to somehow analyse it.

it heavily uses TectoMT - a "highly modular NLP (Natural Language Processing) software system implemented in Perl programming language under Linux." (from their site, http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/tectomt/)

I guess it's all in GNU GPL v2, because it uses some chunks of GPL code now and then
[if it were my choice, I would use BSD, but what are you gonna do]

if you really want to use it, install TectoMT, put Zpravostroj/Modules into PERL5LIB and PERLLIB somehow, set some of the configure.yaml stuff like RSS and database, and ... do whatever you like, if you are lucky enough to figure out how to run it. and since it doesn't have any coherent output - YET - you probably won't be lucky enough.

but you can't expect writing long readme from me now, can you?

thats all for now I guess
